      "deviceMessage": {
        "foo": 23,
        "bar": "ubirch-sensor-data"
      }
    }'

    curl -XPOST localhost:8080/api/avatarService/v1/device/update -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
        "deviceId": "57a7892e-e707-4256-81e4-2e579213e6b8",

          "ubirch#0",
          "actor"
        ],
        "deviceMessage": {
          "foo": 23,
          "bar": "ubirch-sensor-data"
        }
    }'

#### Bulk

TODO: add description

    curl -XPOST localhost:8080/api/avatarService/v1/device/bulk -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{

          "bar": "ubirch-sensor-data"
        }
    }'

#### History (From-To)

Historic data is generated by sending in raw data which is then transformed to "processed" data.

The main difference between raw and processed data is simple. Raw data has been generated by devices and is not human
readable. Applying a device specific transformation to raw data we get processed data which is human readable.

Query historic device data (CAUTION: `from` and `page_size` may be zero or larger):

    curl -XGET localhost:8080/api/avatarService/v1/device/<DEVICE_ID>/data/history

    curl -XGET localhost:8080/api/avatarService/v1/device/<DEVICE_ID>/data/history/<FROM>

    curl -XGET localhost:8080/api/avatarService/v1/device/<DEVICE_ID>/data/history/<FROM>/<PAGE_SIZE>

#### History (By Date)

Historic data is generated by sending in raw data which is then transformed to "processed" data.

The main difference between raw and processed data is simple. Raw data has been generated by devices and is not human 
readable. Applying a device specific transformation to raw data we get processed data which is human readable.

Query historic device data **between** a `from` and `to` (including both borders):

    curl -XGET localhost:8080/api/avatarService/v1/device/<DEVICE_ID>/data/history/byDate/from/$FROM_DATE/to/$TO_DATE

Query historic device data *before* a specific date:

    curl -XGET localhost:8080/api/avatarService/v1/device/<DEVICE_ID>/data/history/byDate/before/$DATE

Query historic device data *after* a specific date:

    curl -XGET localhost:8080/api/avatarService/v1/device/<DEVICE_ID>/data/history/byDate/after/$DATE

Query historic device data of a *whole* day:

    curl -XGET localhost:8080/api/avatarService/v1/device/<DEVICE_ID>/data/history/byDate/day/$DATE


### Device Types

Devices have types and this set of methods allows us to manage them.

#### Query all available device types

    curl -XGET localhost:8080/api/avatarService/v1/device/deviceType

#### Create device type

    curl -XPOST localhost:8080/api/avatarService/v1/device/deviceType -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
        "key": "trackle",
        "name": {
          "de": "Trackle",
          "en": "Trackle"
        },
        "icon": "trackle",
        "defaults": {
          "properties": {},

          "tags": [
            "ubirch#1",
            "actor",
            "trackle"
